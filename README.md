## 🌟 Featured Projects
### [Surakshamitra-Behavioral Continuous Authentication](https://github.com/ESR-style/surakshamitra)
A lightweight behavioral and cognitive authentication system for mobile banking. Uses Siamese Neural Networks to identify users based on typing cadence, swipe flow, and decision patterns — even with just 7 samples. Built end-to-end with React Native, FastAPI, and ML models trained in Python.

### [Expense Tracker](https://github.com/ESR-style/expense-tracker)
A comprehensive expense tracking application featuring full frontend-backend integration, JWT authentication, and PostgreSQL for data management. This project showcases my ability to develop user-friendly interfaces while ensuring secure data handling.

### [Agriguard](https://github.com/ESR-style/agriguard)
An agriculture-focused application designed to provide essential resources and support to farmers. This project highlights my commitment to using technology for social good, combining my skills in web development with a focus on real-world applications.

My personal portfolio showcasing the skills, projects, and experiences that define my journey as a software developer.

## Red Team & Bug Bounty Work
I actively contribute to securing the web through bug bounty programs and ethical hacking:
✅ Valid vulnerability triaged on HackerOne
🛡️ Exposed real-world flaws like unauthenticated S3 access, rate-limit bypass, and IDORs
⚔️ Manual recon and attack chaining using Burp Suite, Caido, and custom scripts
👨‍💻 Focused on low-signal, high-impact vulnerabilities — proving that hacking is as much about creativity as code

## What Drives Me
Whether it's helping farmers manage their finances, protecting users through behavioral biometrics, or breaking into poorly secured apps to report flaws, I build with purpose. I'm not here to just code — I'm here to create tools that matter, break things for good, and push tech boundaries.
